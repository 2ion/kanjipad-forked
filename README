kanjipad-forked
===============

This is an improved, extended and polished fork of the original KanjiPad
written by Owen Taylor. It remains a Japanese handwriting recognition
tool. Please see README.old for eventually important information.

Installation
============

The Debian package is as of now broken, hence simply run 'make install'.
Important is that in order to satisfy glib2's GSettings class, you
*must run at least* 'make glib2schema' to put - surprise - the config
schema in the right place. Because of that, it works only if you have
either /usr or /usr/local as a prefix or get glib2 to look for its
schemas under your nondefault prefix. Sorry.

Changelog & TODO
================

kanjipad f-0.2
--------------

 * Persistent settings via GSettings
 * Font selection
 * Updated menu structure
 * About dialog

Upcoming
--------

 * Navigatable history stack for batch clipping
 * Move result list to the bottom
 * Enhance usability for scripting by providing unnoisy output to stdout
   or another file and a exec() capability where the history stack
   is passed as arguments to the forked process
 * Make menu bar hidable
